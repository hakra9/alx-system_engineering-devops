    """function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    Args:
        list_of_integers (list): a list of integers

    Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity.
    Note: there may be more than one peak in the list.

    The most naive solution to this is to just go through each element
    one-by-one and see if it's qualified as a peak. This solution will take
    O(n) time complexity at the worst case and O(1) for space 
  

    Returns:
        int: peak(s)
